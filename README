1) To build, use 'make'.
2) To clean, use 'make clean'.
3) To run server listening on 3500 port:
      cd server
      ./sysrepod param

   In another XTERM window start sample client that talks SRD (Sys Repo Daemon) protocol:
     cd client_SRD
     # To run client that issues a few commands and exits. Server keeps running.
     ./clientsrd          

4) One can run many clients in parallel from separate XTERM windows.
5) ClientSRD.cpp implements a client class that talks SRD protocol. One can create additional classes
   for different protocols by deriving from the base class Client implemented in Client.cpp.
6) mainSRDClient.cpp implements a sample client that talks SRD.
7) mainSysRedoD.cpp implements the SysRepo Daemon. 
8) DataStore.cpp implements the Data Store class. One can have many Data Stores.
9) libsrd.a is the library that any client talking SRD protocol will link with.
