# Define data stores: Data Store Name, its xmlData file, a dir that contains XSLT
# files specifying Data Store's syntactic and semantic contraints (all files in one directory),
# and another dir where Yang model is present with name <data_store>.yang. Both dir names
# are optional. If yangdir is present then xsldir must be present. xsldir may be empty.
# NOTE that data store name must be same as the BASE of yang file in yangdir.
# For example, yangDirFor_sshd_config dir must contain a file 'sshd_config.yang'.
# The name of XML file and xsltdir could be any string.
